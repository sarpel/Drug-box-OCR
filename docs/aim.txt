We are not going into testing phase. we have features to implement. I think you understand what this project is aiming to do. As you can see from files, there are some drug boxes, pill boxes and similar boxes' names are too long and too strangely named names and i want yo implement a fast alternative to enter this name in my apps input textboxes. I have excel database of a list of all drug names sold in turkey. I want this project to compare what it reads from its camera and compares what it read with the drug database and matches its name in there, then it should write "DATABASE NAME" of the match. For example if ocr read "dolorex abdi ibrahim 20 tablet diklofenak sodyum" which are commercial name + company + pill count + chemical ingredient" and matched dolorex in database, it should log it as "DOLOREX TABLET", because its name is this in the database. then automatically copies "DOLOREX TABLET" into the clipboard automatically and paste it in an app active on screen, especially a textbox whose coordinates are always the same. then app will trigger some macros in windows 11 via a companion applet you will write for it. Can you comprehent this project. If so, write an improvement_plan.md for it as this directives.
